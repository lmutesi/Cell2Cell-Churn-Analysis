# Cell2Cell-Churn-Analysis
## Cell2Cell Churn Analysis and Retention Strategies
### Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for Cell2Cell, the 6th largest wireless company in the U.S. with 10 million customers. With a monthly churn rate of 4%, half of which is voluntary, the analysis aims to identify key churn predictors and propose actionable strategies to improve customer retention and lifetime value (LTV).

### Key Features
Data: A dataset of 71,047 customers and 66 variables used for predictive modeling.
**Methods**: Employed statistical and machine learning approaches, including logistic regression with regularization, to identify churn drivers and validate model performance.
### Outcomes: Proposed two retention strategies:

Contract Bundle â€“ Device & Plan: Incentivize longer contracts with bundled device offers.

Monthly Minutes of Use Rewards: Encourage higher plan usage with targeted rewards.

### Insights
**Top Churn Predictors**:
Length of time with current equipment (+43.5% churn odds per standard deviation increase).

Number of unique subscriptions (+24% churn odds).

Service duration (-20.5% churn odds per standard deviation decrease).

**Economic Impact:**
Increase LTV across customer segments with tailored strategies.

**Project Deliverables**

Notebook: Contains data exploration, model building, and evaluation processes.
